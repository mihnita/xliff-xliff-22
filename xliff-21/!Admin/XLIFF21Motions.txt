cos02-> os special majority motion

XLIFF TC having received comments during the 60 day public review period of XLIFF V2.1 COS01, those comments having resulted in non-material error corrections and editorial improvements in the current working draft labeled in advance as COS02 (http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/xliff/trunk/xliff-21/xliff-core-v2.1-cos02.html [revision 983]), and the corrections made being described in the error log on our SVN (http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/xliff/trunk/xliff-21/%21Admin/COS01_CommentsDisposal/Simple-comment-resolution-log_XLIFF_2.1_cos01.pdf), I now move that the TC approve the above identified draft as XLIFF Version 2.1 Candidate OASIS Standard 02 and further request the TC Officers to request that TC Administration open a Special Majority Vote to approve submitting COS02 to the OASIS membership in a call for consent. By this motion, the TC confirms that all changes made were non-material and only made to address the reported issues. 



Non-material errors in XLIFF V2.1 COS01 having been reported to the TC during the 60 day public review period, those non-material errors having been corrected in working draft 05 contained in <url to wd05>, and the corrections made being described in <where ever you record the changes>, I now move that the TC approve XLIFF V2.1 WD## as Candidate OASIS Standard 02 and further request the Chair to request that TC Administration open a Special Majority Vote to approve submitting COS02 to the OASIS membership in a call for consent. By this motion, the TC confirms that all changes made were non-material and only made to address the reported errors.
