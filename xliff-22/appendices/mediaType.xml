        >Media Type Registration Template for XLIFF Version 2.0</ulink> published on 22 September
        2014, which is also the latest version of the Registration Template, as the TC decided to
        merge the template (with some necessary editorial updates) with this XLIFF Version &version;
        specification. Additionally, the Security Considerations have been substantially expanded
        based on an IESG Expert feedback, as per this archived conversation <ulink
