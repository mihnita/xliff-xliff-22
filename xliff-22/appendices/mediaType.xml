    <title>MIME Type for XLIFF Version 2.0 and Later Releases</title>

    <para>A MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions type) is a two-part identifier for file
        formats and format content transmitted on the Internet. The MIME type is the mechanism used
        to tell a client application the type of document being transferred from a server. It is
        important that servers are set up correctly so that the correct MIME type is transferred
        with each document.</para>
